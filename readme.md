### About the Data

The dataset consists of reports filed between 2004 and 2014 by New York City Parks Department employees related to the discovery of decapitated animals in New York City public parks. The discoveries range from goat heads to headless chickens to cats, dogs and apparently some sort of pig. (For more information on this phenomenon, you can read [this New York Magazine story](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/03/mystery-of-the-prospect-park-goat-heads.html).) The data has been transcribed and cleaned up from its raw, pdf format, for easy manipulation.
